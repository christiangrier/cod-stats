Competitive Call of Duty has may different aspects that can be discovered and learned through data analysis. Through my experience with eSports obtaining data has always been the more difficult piece to obtain. This project hopes to solve that by being a data ingestion tool by viewing CDL matches. 

## Things to do:
- Screenshots of match streams
    - Obtain specified location screen shots instead of entire display view
    - reduce file size of screenshots for reading
- read images to text through OCR
- write text to file 
- convert data in file to metrics (k/d, engagements, hilltime, etc.)
- write metrics to a new file per team/player
